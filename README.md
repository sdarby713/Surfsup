A trip to Honolulu, Hawaii is in the works!  So naturally, we'd like to know what kind of weather to expect.  climate_starter.ipynb
will analyze temperature and preciptation observations from a set of Hawaiian weather stations.
Not being content with that, we can also provide them to others through an api server, which is driven by app.py
